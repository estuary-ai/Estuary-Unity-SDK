# Estuary-Unity-SDK

## Description
The Estuary Unity SDK (dubbed **Mangrove SDK**) is a Unity plugin which allows for easy connection 
to a running instance of [Mangrove](https://github.com/Al-Estuary/mangrove),
the backend server component of Estuary.  This plugin includes a simple 
example scene and a boilerplate prefab to help speed up development with 
Estuary.  Our SDK leverages the 
[SocketIO](https://github.com/itisnajim/SocketIOUnity)
Unity plugin, so connections can be made conveniently by specifying 
the local IP address and port number of your Mangrove instance.
